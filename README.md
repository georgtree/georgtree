## Hello, my name is George Iashin.

### My interests:

- Compact (SPICE) modelling
- Semiconductors modelling and simulation
- Programming in Tcl and C
- SPICE simulation
- Math

### Projects

- Math utilities:
  - **[tclinterp](https://github.com/georgtree/tclinterp)**: A Tcl C extension that provides interpolation and
    approximation functions implemented in C.
  - **[tclopt](https://github.com/georgtree/tclopt)**: A Tcl C extension that provides procedures for least-squares
    fitting and stochastic optimization.
  - **[extexpr](https://github.com/georgtree/extexpr)**: A Tcl C extension that expands the `::tcl::mathfunc` namespace
    with functions operating on vectors.
- SPICE utilities:
  - **[SpiceGenTcl](https://github.com/georgtree/SpiceGenTcl)**: A Tcl extension that provides a Tcl object-oriented
    interface to various SPICE and SPICE-like simulators such as Ngspice, Xyce, etc.
  - **[NgspiceTclBridge](https://github.com/georgtree/NgspiceTclBridge)**: A Tcl C extension that provides a Tcl
    interface to a dynamically loaded shared Ngspice simulator.
  - **[tclmeasure](https://github.com/georgtree/tclmeasure)**: A Tcl C extension that provides an equivalent of the
    `measure` command in SPICE and SPICE-like simulators for vector data processing.
- Tcl utilities
  - **[argparse](https://github.com/georgtree/argparse)**: A Tcl C extension that provides argument preprocessing for
    Tcl, forked from the `argparse` project by Andy Goth.
  - **[rbc-tk9](https://github.com/georgtree/rbc-tk9)**: A Tcl C extension that provides a fast 2D and histogram
    plotting environment, forked from the `rbc-tk9` project updated by Emiliano Gavil√°n, originally developed by the
    `Rbc` team.
  - **[tcl_tools](https://github.com/georgtree/tcl_tools)**: A Tcl extension that provides tools for working with
    Gnuplot, 2-port RF parameters (S, Z, Y, T), reading Touchstone files, and various mathematical functions.
